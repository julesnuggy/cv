  "bio": "In 2018, after 8 years as a Change Management Consultant, I decided to pursue my ambition to become a Software Developer by joining Makers Academy. There, I learnt to code in just 4 months, and secured my first job as a Software Developer just 1 month after graduating. I love being a Software Developer because I get a lot of satisfaction from problem solving; working in a trusting and collaborative environment; and bringing ideas into reality through elegant code.\n\nMy experience on a wide variety of projects has expanded and bolstered my knowledge of programming best practices, architectures, design patterns, and principles. I bring many skills from my consultancy background, including: customer engagement, project management, workshop facilitation, business & data analytics, and ideation.\n",
