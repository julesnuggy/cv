  "bio": "I love being a software developer because I enjoy problem solving, working in a trusting and collaborative environment, and bringing ideas into reality through elegant code.\n\nIn 2018, I changed my career as a change management consultant to become a software developer by joining Makers Academy. There, I learnt to code in just 4 months, and started my first job only 1 month after graduating.\n\nMy experience on a wide variety of projects has expanded and bolstered my knowledge of programming best practices, architectures, design patterns, and principles.\n\nI bring many skills from my consultancy background, including: customer engagement, project management, workshop facilitation, business & data analytics, and ideation.\n",
