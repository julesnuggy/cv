  "bio": "I love being a software developer because I enjoy problem solving, working in a trusting and collaborative\n      environment, and bringing ideas into reality through elegant code. In 2018, I changed my career as a change\n      management consultant to become a software developer by joining Makers Academy. There, I learnt to code in just 4\n      months, and started my first job only 1 month after graduating.\n      My experience on a wide variety of projects has expanded and bolstered my knowledge of programming best practices,\n      architectures, design patterns, and principles. I bring many skills from my consultancy background, including:\n      customer engagement, project management, workshop facilitation, business & data analytics, and ideation.\n",
